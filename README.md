FCFS:

Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P3 -> P4

Average Waiting Time: 31.25

Average Turnaround Time: 57.5

SJF:
Process Order: P1 -> P4 -> P2 -> P3

Average Waiting Time: 23.75

Average Turnaround Time: 50.0

Priority:

Process Order: P1 -> P2 -> P4 -> P3

Average Waiting Time: 25.0

Average Turnaround Time: 51.25

The best algorithm is: SJF as it provides proper fairness and is more efficient
